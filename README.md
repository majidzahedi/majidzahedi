# Hey there! 👋 I'm Majid Zahedi

> Full-Stack Developer | Node.js Specialist | DevOps Enthusiast

I build scalable, high-performance web applications from the ground up. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect user interfaces or architecting robust backend systems, I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

I'm a full-stack engineer who lives in the sweet spot between frontend finesse and backend brilliance. My day might start with optimizing React components and end with fine-tuning RabbitMQ consumers – and I love every minute of it.

## 💻 Tech Arsenal

### Frontend
```
⚛️  React · Next.js · TanStack (Query, Table, Router, etc.)
🎨  Modern UI/UX · Component Architecture · State Management
⚡  Performance Optimization · SSR/SSG
```

### Backend
```
🟢  Node.js Ecosystem
🚀  Express · Fastify · NestJS
📡  REST APIs · GraphQL · RPC-like APIs
🔌  Real-time: Socket.io · WebSocket
📬  Message Queues: BullMQ · RabbitMQ
```

### DevOps & Infrastructure
```
🐳  Docker · Containerization
🔧  Linux System Administration
⚙️  CI/CD Pipelines · Self-hosted GitLab
🏗️  Infrastructure as Code
```

## 🎯 What Makes Me Tick

- **Full-Stack Fluency**: I don't just build frontends or backends – I architect complete systems where every layer talks to the others seamlessly
- **Real-Time Expertise**: From WebSockets to message queues, I know how to keep data flowing and users connected
- **DevOps Mindset**: I don't just write code; I deploy it, monitor it, and make sure it scales
- **Performance Obsessed**: Whether it's frontend rendering or backend throughput, I'm always hunting for that extra millisecond

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns I Love

- **Microservices**: Breaking down monoliths into maintainable, scalable services
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using message queues for reliable, async communication
- **Real-Time Systems**: Building responsive, live-updating applications
- **API Design**: Crafting intuitive, well-documented interfaces (REST, GraphQL, you name it)
- **Containerization**: Docker-first development and deployment strategies

## 📊 My Approach

```typescript
class MyWorkflow {
  readonly principles = [
    "Write clean, maintainable code",
    "Test early, test often",
    "Document everything that matters",
    "Performance is a feature",
    "Security is non-negotiable"
  ];

  buildFeature(requirements: Requirements): Feature {
    return this
      .design(requirements)
      .implement()
      .test()
      .deploy()
      .monitor();
  }
}
```
